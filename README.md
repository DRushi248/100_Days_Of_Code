# ****#100 Days of Code**** 


Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "100 Days of Code" challenge! Over the next 100 days, I'm committed to significantly improving my programming skills by focusing on mastering data structures and algorithms, enhancing problem-solving abilities, and deepening my understanding of these crucial computer science concepts.


## **About the Challenge**


The "100 Days of Code" is a challenge that encourages consistent coding practice. It's about committing to code for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days. This repository is a testament to my journey, reflecting my daily progress and the coding exercises I undertake.


_
## **Goals**


* **Data Structures & Algorithms Mastery:** To deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms through C++.
* **Consistent Learning:** To maintain a streak of coding for at least one hour every day.
* **Problem-Solving Enhancement:** To improve my problem-solving skills by tackling diverse coding challenges.


## **Progress Tracker**


The progress for each day will be documented in this section, including key concepts and any specific challenges encountered. This section will be updated regularly to reflect ongoing learning.
